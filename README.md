# Bain

Bain is a DIY wireless thermometer. It is made of two parts:

- [Adafruit Feather HUZZAH with ESP8266](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821): it's an Arduino compatible board that has WiFi and a connector to plug any Adafruit 3.7V Lithium polymer batteries. 
- [Adafruit BME280 I2C or SPI](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2652): It's an environmental sensor with temperature, barometric pressure and humidity from Bosch.

This repository contains all the instructions to build the thermometer yourself. Generated data are sent to an MQTT broker but the code should be easily adaptable to the most convenient method that fit your needs.
